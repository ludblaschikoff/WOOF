# **WOOF_Project**

Scripts and pipelines used to analyze extant and ancient HTS data from the WOOF project. The steps envolve pre-processing, mapping, variant calling and population genomics analysis. Designed for the analysis of Illumina sequences obtained from Portuguese and Spanish specimens generated by the WOOF project and reference sequences retrieved from database.

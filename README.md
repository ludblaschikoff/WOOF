# WOOF_Project
Scripts and pipelines used to analyze extant and ancient HTS data from the WOOF project. The steps envolve pre-processing, mapping, variant calling and population genomics analysis. Designed for the analysis of Illumina sequences obtained from Portuguese and Spanish specimens.

# #Fastq2BAM - Read filter and mapping
- Scripts to analyze modern HTS data (DOGPT12-DOGPT79) from preprocessing to mapping.
- Scripts to analyze modern HTS data (Dabase_data) from preprocessing to mapping.
- (SCRIPTS_IN_PROGRESS) has SCRIPTS being developed to improve future analysis.

# #FILO - Mitochondrial Filogenies

# #POP_GEN - Population analyses based on variant calling

# #Chalcolithic_Paper
Scripts and pipelines used to analyze modern (DOGPT12-DOGPT70) and acient HTS data (see Table_S2) for the paper "A multidisciplinary study of Iberian Chalcolithic dogs" published in JAS:Reports.
